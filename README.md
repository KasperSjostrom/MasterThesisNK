RPI code comments:
The code runs at the boot of the RPi, sending the ASCII letter 'Z' continuously. From keyboard input, the code changes the sent message to a desired one based on the if statements. 


MATLAB code comments:
Avg_width is only for the width, modification is needed to test other parameters such as, directory and plot axis
MultiscanCorr is for correlation of the different spectra, here the directory needs to be changed
